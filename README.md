# CPRD Aurum MASTERMIND scripts

MASTERMIND (MRC APBI Stratification and Extreme Response Mechanism IN Diabetes) is a UK Medical Research Council funded (MR/N00633X/1 and MR/W003988/1) study consortium exploring stratified (precision) treatment in Type 2 diabetes. Part of this work uses data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); originally the 'GOLD' version which was processed as per [Rodgers et al. 2017](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e017989). Papers produced from this dataset include:
* [Precision Medicine in Type 2 Diabetes: Clinical Markers of Insulin Resistance Are Associated With Altered Short- and Long-term Glycemic Response to DPP-4 Inhibitor Therapy](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/41/4/705/36908/Precision-Medicine-in-Type-2-Diabetes-Clinical) Dennis et al. 2018
* [Sex and BMI Alter the Benefits and Risks of Sulfonylureas and Thiazolidinediones in Type 2 Diabetes: A Framework for Evaluating Stratification Using Routine Clinical and Individual Trial Data](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/41/9/1844/40749/Sex-and-BMI-Alter-the-Benefits-and-Risks-of) Dennis et al. 2018
* [Time trends and geographical variation in prescribing of drugs for diabetes in England from 1998 to 2017](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.13346) Curtis et al. 2018

Recently we have recreated the above processing pipeline in CPRD Aurum, and this repository contains the scripts used to do this. Raw text files from CPRD were imported into a MySQL database using a custom-built package ([aurum](https://github.com/drkgyoung/Exeter_Diabetes_aurum_package)) built by Dr Robert Challen. This package also includes functions to allow easy querying of the MySQL tables from R, using the 'dbplyr' tidyverse package. Codelists used for querying the data (denoted as 'codes$\[codelist_name\]' in scripts) can be found in our [CPRD-Codelists repository](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-Codelists).
