# CPRD Aurum MASTERMIND scripts

MASTERMIND (MRC APBI Stratification and Extreme Response Mechanism IN Diabetes) is a UK Medical Research Council funded (MR/N00633X/1 and MR/W003988/1) study consortium exploring stratified (precision) treatment in Type 2 diabetes. Part of this work uses data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); originally the 'GOLD' version which was processed as per [Rodgers et al. 2017](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e017989).

Recently we have recreated the above processing pipeline in CPRD Aurum, and this repository contains the scripts used to do this. Raw text files from CPRD were imported into a MySQL database using a custom-built package ([aurum](https://github.com/drkgyoung/Exeter_Diabetes_aurum_package)) built by Dr Robert Challen. This package also includes functions to allow easy querying of the MySQL tables from R, using the 'dbplyr' tidyverse package. Codelists used for querying the data (denoted as 'codes$\{codelist_name\}' in scripts) can be found in our [CPRD-Codelists repository](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-Codelists).

&nbsp;

## Summary of scripts and their outputs

'Drug' refers to diabetes medications unless otherwise stated, and the drug classes analysed by these scripts are acarbose, DPP4-inhibitors, glinides, GLP1 receptor agonists, metformin, SGLT2-inhibitors, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. 'Outputs' are the primary MySQL tables produced by each script. Various scripts link to our [CPRD-Codelists repository](https://github.com/Exeter-Diabetes/CPRD-Codelists) which contains more details on the algorithms used to define variables such as ethnicity and diabetes type - see individual scripts for links to the appropriate part of the CPRD-Codelists repository. The variables in each of the output tables and their definitions are listed in the [Data Dictionary]().
