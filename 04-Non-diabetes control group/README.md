# Non-diabetes control group

We obtained CPRD primary care data and linked HES APC, ONS death and patient IMD data on the IDs in the CPRD Aurum June 2024 release who were not included in our diabetes extract (n=2,727,999 in diabetes extract). As the CPRD Aurum June 2024 release was no longer available to make extractions from, we used the denominator files for this extract to identify IDs which were also in the Aurum March and September 2024 releases, and used these releases for the primary care data. The June 2024 release contained 47,766,944 IDs with 'acceptable' data quality in total, 45,038,945 of whom were not in our diabetes extract. 44,972,049 (99.85%) of these were also in the September 2024 release and so we extracted their primary care data from the September 2024 release. A further 65,820 were not in the September 2024 release, but were in the March 2024 release and so we extracted their primary care data from there.
